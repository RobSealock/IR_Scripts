Process & Memory Analysis
Tool	IR Use Cases
Process Explorer	Identify suspicious processes, parent/child anomalies, unsigned DLLs, injected modules, network connections, service hosting abuse
Process Monitor (ProcMon)	Real‑time tracing of file/registry/process activity, persistence creation, malware behavior, config writes, credential theft indicators
RAMMap	Detect abnormal memory usage, large allocations, ransomware staging, memory leaks
VMMap	Inspect per‑process memory layout, detect injected code, RWX pages, suspicious memory regions
PsList	Lightweight process listing, hidden process detection, cross‑checking with other tools
Network & Remote Activity
Tool	IR Use Cases
TCPView	Identify C2 connections, suspicious ports, process‑to‑socket mapping, beaconing behavior
PsPing	Validate connectivity to suspicious hosts, measure latency during LM investigations
PsExec	Investigate remote execution artifacts, replicate attacker behavior, remote triage collection
Persistence & Autostart Analysis
Tool	IR Use Cases
Autoruns	Comprehensive persistence sweep: Run keys, services, drivers, tasks, WMI, BHOs, AppInit DLLs, COM hijacks; export for offline review
PsService	Enumerate services, detect malicious service creation, identify service hijacking
File System & Disk Forensics
Tool	IR Use Cases
SigCheck	Verify signatures, detect unsigned/tampered binaries, hash files, check VirusTotal reputation, detect timestomping
Streams	Identify Alternate Data Streams (ADS), detect hidden payloads or metadata
SDelete	Securely wipe malicious files post‑containment, detect attacker attempts at secure deletion
Disk2vhd	Create VHD snapshots for offline forensic analysis, preserve evidence safely
System State & Environment Analysis
Tool	IR Use Cases
Sysmon	High‑fidelity logging: process creation, network connections, registry changes, driver loads, WMI events, file creation
PsInfo	Collect OS metadata, installed patches, uptime, system configuration — useful for scoping
PsLoggedOn	Identify interactive/remote logons, detect lateral movement, validate suspicious account activity
Malware & Behavior Analysis
Tool	IR Use Cases
Strings	Extract strings from binaries, find C2 URLs, commands, embedded configs, malware hints
SigCheck	(Also used here) PE metadata, version anomalies, reputation checks
Rootkit & Stealth Technique Detection
Tool	IR Use Cases
